                            employees, visitors, and contractors, comply with all relevant local, state, and federal
                            laws and regulations related to workplace health and safety. All employees are expected
                            to adhere to these laws and regulations at all times. Employees are encouraged to report
                            all hazards and unsafe conditions immediately to their supervisors or designated safety

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Fair Work Amendment Act 2013 defines workplace bullying as repeated unreasonable
                            behavior by an individual towards a worker which creates a risk to health and safety.
                            Bullying behavior can range from obvious verbal or physical assault to subtle
                            psychological abuse. It can include physical or verbal abuse; yelling, screaming or
                            offensive language; excluding or isolating employees; psychological harassment;
                            intimidation; assigning meaningless tasks unrelated to the job; giving employees
                            impossible jobs; deliberately changed work rosters to inconvenience particular
                            employees; undermining work performance by deliberately withholding information vital
                            for effective work performance.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Our dress code is casual, but it's essential to prioritize safety. You must wear
                            clothing that provides protection from the weather and the potential hazards of
                            machinery. When working in the field, you are required to wear hats, closed-toe
                            footwear, and either long sleeves or sunscreen. In the packing shed, wear hairnets or
                            hats along with closed footwear. Please refrain from wearing singlets, bikinis, or going
                            shirtless anywhere on the farm. Failure to adhere to these clothing guidelines is a
                            breach of your health and safety responsibilities, and it may result in immediate
                            dismissal. Your safety is our top priority.

                        <p>
                            The primary language for communication within the workplace is English. English must be
                            used for all official business and operational communications. In situations where it is
                            necessary for clear and effective communication, employees are permitted to use their
                            native language. However, this should be the exception rather than the rule, and it is
                            encouraged only when it enhances comprehension and eliminates misunderstandings. If an
                            employee's communication difficulties become an issue and affect workflow or create
                            risks, they may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination

                        <p>
                            In order to maintain a high standard of hygiene and safety, all employees involved in
                            fruit handling are required to adhere to the following hand hygiene guidelines:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Before Commencing Work: Hands must be washed before the start of each work period.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After Using the Toilet: Handwashing is mandatory immediately after using the toilet.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After Contact with Face: Hands should be washed after touching the nose or mouth.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After Handling Contaminated Material: Following contact with contaminated materials
                                such as boxes and tools, hands must be thoroughly washed.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            It's important to note that wearing gloves does not replace the necessity of handwashing
                            as outlined above. This protocol ensures a clean and safe working environment.

                                To ensure the highest standards of food hygiene, all individuals are expected to
                                observe the following guidelines:

                                Food Handling Areas: While in food handling areas, individuals must refrain from
                                behaviors that could lead to food contamination. This includes eating, smoking,
                                chewing, or any other unhygienic conduct.

                                to promptly inform the First Aid Officer for immediate treatment. Any worker with an
                                existing treatment, like a band-aid or bandage, must seek approval from the First

                                Communicable Diseases: Individuals with communicable diseases or conditions, such as
                                colds, flu, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting, must inform their employer and refrain
                                from attending work until they have fully recovered from the condition.

                    The Employer and the Employee agree to enter into this Piecework Agreement (Agreement) under
                    clause 15 (Pieceworkers) of the Horticulture Award 2020 [MA000028] (Award). The Employer and
                    Employee mutually agree as follows:
                </li>
                <li>
                    1. Description of Work: The work to be performed under this Agreement includes various tasks
                    such as strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, grape, tomato, cherry tomato, capsicum, vegetable,
                    mushroom, apple picking, packaging, and warehouse operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Minimum Piecework Rate: The Employer agrees to pay the Employee the piecework rate specified
                    in Schedule A attached to this Agreement for performing the Work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. If during the currency of this agreement, the minimum remuneration of the employee, averaged
                    over a period of three consecutive days, is less than such employee would have earned had he or
                    she been employed at the hourly rate prescribed by the award for the class of work plus 25%,
                    then this agreement may be terminated forthwith by giving notice of intention to terminate the
                    agreement by one party to the other.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. Payment Method: The piecework rate in this Agreement must be paid for all work performed in
                    adherence to this Agreement. It will serve as the payment method, replacing the hourly or weekly
                    wages mentioned in clause 14 of the Award. For casual employees, the calculation of piecework
                    rates includes the prescribed casual loading.
                </li>
                <li>
                    5. Rate Review: The piecework rate in this Agreement will be subject to review. This review will
                    consider any changes in the Award rate, alterations in the work's nature, or adjustments to the
                    working conditions to ensure that the minimum requirements established in clause 15 of the Award
                    continue to be met.
                </li>
                <li>
                    6. Productivity and Guaranteed Minimum Wage: The Employee's earnings depend on their
                    productivity. However, even if productivity is low, the Employer guarantees the Employee a
                    minimum hourly wage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    7. Record Keeping: Both the Employer and the Employee will maintain a copy of this Agreement for
                    reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    8. Employment Type: The Employee is engaged as a casual employee.
